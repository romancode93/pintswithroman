    <p> I love all things sciency and pride myself on staying tech savvy. When I am not busy pulling my hair out overcoming
      the profound intricacies of Engineering/CAD/CAE, I tend to unwind at the park with the boys over an intimate game
      of <st>footy</st> and top of the evening with a few <strong>pints</strong> and the proverbial <em><strong> Pint Talk.
        </strong></em>

     <p>
        Since graduating high school, I noticed life started moving at a pace. Everyone is engrossed
        with their own set of problems and invested in their own tailored dreams. To the point where
        it becomes difficult to make time for friends and family. <br>
        However, it is just as important that we spend that odd leisure hour here and there to unwind and
        maintain some semblence of mental health by rewarding ourselves. <br />
        With that purpose in mind, I created <strong>Pints with Roman</strong>, a place to honor
        social commitments. <br>This is a platform which
        allows me to keep my friends and family informed about any life updates and indulge them in the
        proverbial <em><strong>Pint Talk!</strong></em> <br>
        'Tis quite simple! Through the <strong>contact me</strong> link at the bottom of the page, you can <em>contact me</em> and leave
        your <em>details and preferred date & time</em>. We can exchange dialogue over emails and agree on a preferred platform
        to video call (I would recommend Zoom!) and set up a mutually agreed apointment. <br>
        The appointment does not have to be long but I do suggest you do yourself the courtesy to set-aside
        atleast a quarter-hour to relax and indulge in a fine drink with your pal. Now the premise is Pints
        and I suggest we each treat ourselves to the amber elixir, but you may choose to indulge in any other
        choice-drink. While the premise remains the drink(I do suggest you indulge in the odd glass of alcohol
        but coffee does the trick just as well), I want you to utilize this time and social-appointment to divulge
        and absorb information about you & me. You may wish to indulge in any life updates, discuss any life-choices
        you seek to make, discuss a hobby, a sport, or simply discuss a friend or mutual personality. The point is
        to have a place that allows you to check-out of your busy life and take a breath. Think of it as a breather.
        Indulge in a smoke if that's what it takes for you to relax, but make time for the casual. Feel like you are being
        heard and be a social being. Indulge in some Pint talk. There was a time when a lot of you did confide in me, I just want you to know
        that I am here if you wanna get a word out.
